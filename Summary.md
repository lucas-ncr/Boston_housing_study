# Boston housing study

## 🏡 Boston Housing Data Analysis
As a Data Scientist with a housing agency in Boston, MA, I analyzed a historical dataset on housing prices derived from the U.S. Census Service. My goal was to extract meaningful insights and present them to upper management to support informed decision-making. 📊

Using my statistical expertise and Python libraries like SciPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and NumPy, I explored the following key questions:

###✅ Did houses bounded by the Charles River have significantly different median values compared to those that weren’t?

###🏠 How did the median values of houses vary based on the proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940?

###☢️ Was there a relationship between nitric oxide concentration and the proportion of non-retail business acres per town?

###📍 How did an additional weighted distance to the five Boston employment centers impact the median value of owner-occupied homes?

To uncover insights, I generated relevant statistics and created visualizations that highlighted key trends and patterns. Each graph included a brief explanation to ensure clarity for upper management. By leveraging data-driven storytelling, I provided actionable insights that helped guide strategic housing decisions. 🏡✨
